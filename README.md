# Randomizer-Wheel
Randomizer wheel with a GUI
By: Cole Paulline

Program runs and creates a GUI for a randomizer wheel that allows you to add items and spin for a random choice with some other select features. 

Program is top down and all is functional.

List210 interface was created by Dr.Krieger

Run the program and go through the program on the GUI by adding items by using the text field.

I added a small animation in the beginning that shows a little bit of animation.
